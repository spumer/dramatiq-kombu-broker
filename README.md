# dramatiq-kombu-broker

Dramatiq Kombu-based broker


## Key features:

- Connection pool support (native): no unexpected connections count grow up!
- Channel pool support (via [kombu-pyamqp-threadsafe](https://github.com/spumer/kombu-pyamqp-threadsafe) lib): consume and produce through channels, "Connection limit reach" fixed now!
- Memory protection via configurable max_delay_time limits: prevents RabbitMQ memory exhaustion from long-delayed messages
- **Deadlock protection** via `confirm_timeout`: prevents infinite blocking when RabbitMQ connection fails during message publishing (default: 5s timeout)

### Minor features

- Auto-add hostname to connection props.
- Allow change default queue name without changing each actor (e.g. 'default' -> 'dramatiq'). See [configuration docs](https://spumer.github.io/dramatiq-kombu-broker/configuration/#default_queue_name)
- Consumer healthcheck support
- Ignore topology difference (PreconditionFailed), you can change your queue options safely
- No scary Pika logs. Fully based on kombu.
- ACK/NACK in YOUR middleware. Check message acknowledge status: Message.acknowledged


### Auto-add hostname to connection props. Now you can see location of each connection in RabbitMQ web admin
